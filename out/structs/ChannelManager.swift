/// A lightning node's channel state machine and payment management logic, which facilitates
/// sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through lightning channels.
///
/// [`ChannelManager`] is parameterized by a number of components to achieve this.
/// - [`chain::Watch`] (typically [`ChainMonitor`]) for on-chain monitoring and enforcement of each
/// channel
/// - [`BroadcasterInterface`] for broadcasting transactions related to opening, funding, and
/// closing channels
/// - [`EntropySource`] for providing random data needed for cryptographic operations
/// - [`NodeSigner`] for cryptographic operations scoped to the node
/// - [`SignerProvider`] for providing signers whose operations are scoped to individual channels
/// - [`FeeEstimator`] to determine transaction fee rates needed to have a transaction mined in a
/// timely manner
/// - [`Router`] for finding payment paths when initiating and retrying payments
/// - [`Logger`] for logging operational information of varying degrees
///
/// Additionally, it implements the following traits:
/// - [`ChannelMessageHandler`] to handle off-chain channel activity from peers
/// - [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] to similarly send such messages to peers
/// - [`OffersMessageHandler`] for BOLT 12 message handling and sending
/// - [`EventsProvider`] to generate user-actionable [`Event`]s
/// - [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for notification of on-chain activity
///
/// Thus, [`ChannelManager`] is typically used to parameterize a [`MessageHandler`] and an
/// [`OnionMessenger`]. The latter is required to support BOLT 12 functionality.
///
/// # `ChannelManager` vs `ChannelMonitor`
///
/// It's important to distinguish between the *off-chain* management and *on-chain* enforcement of
/// lightning channels. [`ChannelManager`] exchanges messages with peers to manage the off-chain
/// state of each channel. During this process, it generates a [`ChannelMonitor`] for each channel
/// and a [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] for each relevant change, notifying its parameterized
/// [`chain::Watch`] of them.
///
/// An implementation of [`chain::Watch`], such as [`ChainMonitor`], is responsible for aggregating
/// these [`ChannelMonitor`]s and applying any [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`]s to them. It then monitors
/// for any pertinent on-chain activity, enforcing claims as needed.
///
/// This division of off-chain management and on-chain enforcement allows for interesting node
/// setups. For instance, on-chain enforcement could be moved to a separate host or have added
/// redundancy, possibly as a watchtower. See [`chain::Watch`] for the relevant interface.
///
/// # Initialization
///
/// Use [`ChannelManager::new`] with the most recent [`BlockHash`] when creating a fresh instance.
/// Otherwise, if restarting, construct [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] with the necessary parameters and
/// references to any deserialized [`ChannelMonitor`]s that were previously persisted. Use this to
/// deserialize the [`ChannelManager`] and feed it any new chain data since it was last online, as
/// detailed in the [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] documentation.

///
/// # Operation
///
/// The following is required for [`ChannelManager`] to function properly:
/// - Handle messages from peers using its [`ChannelMessageHandler`] implementation (typically
/// called by [`PeerManager::read_event`] when processing network I/O)
/// - Send messages to peers obtained via its [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] implementation
/// (typically initiated when [`PeerManager::process_events`] is called)
/// - Feed on-chain activity using either its [`chain::Listen`] or [`chain::Confirm`] implementation
/// as documented by those traits
/// - Perform any periodic channel and payment checks by calling [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly
/// every minute
/// - Persist to disk whenever [`get_and_clear_needs_persistence`] returns `true` using a
/// [`Persister`] such as a [`KVStore`] implementation
/// - Handle [`Event`]s obtained via its [`EventsProvider`] implementation
///
/// The [`Future`] returned by [`get_event_or_persistence_needed_future`] is useful in determining
/// when the last two requirements need to be checked.
///
/// The [`lightning-block-sync`] and [`lightning-transaction-sync`] crates provide utilities that
/// simplify feeding in on-chain activity using the [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] traits,
/// respectively. The remaining requirements can be met using the [`lightning-background-processor`]
/// crate. For languages other than Rust, the availability of similar utilities may vary.
///
/// # Channels
///
/// [`ChannelManager`]'s primary function involves managing a channel state. Without channels,
/// payments can't be sent. Use [`list_channels`] or [`list_usable_channels`] for a snapshot of the
/// currently open channels.
///
/// ```
/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
/// #
/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
/// let channels = channel_manager.list_usable_channels();
/// for details in channels {
/// println!(\"{:?}\", details);
/// }
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Each channel is identified using a [`ChannelId`], which will change throughout the channel's
/// life cycle. Additionally, channels are assigned a `user_channel_id`, which is given in
/// [`Event`]s associated with the channel and serves as a fixed identifier but is otherwise unused
/// by [`ChannelManager`].
///
/// ## Opening Channels
///
/// To an open a channel with a peer, call [`create_channel`]. This will initiate the process of
/// opening an outbound channel, which requires self-funding when handling
/// [`Event::FundingGenerationReady`].
///

/// ## Accepting Channels

/// ```
///
/// ## Closing Channels
///
/// There are two ways to close a channel: either cooperatively using [`close_channel`] or
/// unilaterally using [`force_close_broadcasting_latest_txn`]. The former is ideal as it makes for
/// lower fees and immediate access to funds. However, the latter may be necessary if the
/// counterparty isn't behaving properly or has gone offline. [`Event::ChannelClosed`] is generated
/// once the channel has been closed successfully.
///
/// ```
/// # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
/// # use lightning::ln::types::ChannelId;
/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
/// #

/// }
///
/// // On the event processing thread
/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
/// Event::ChannelClosed { channel_id, user_channel_id, ..  } => {
/// assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
/// println!(\"Channel {} closed\", channel_id);
/// },
/// // ...
/// #     _ => {},
/// });
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Payments
///
/// [`ChannelManager`] is responsible for sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through its
/// channels. A payment is typically initiated from a [BOLT 11] invoice or a [BOLT 12] offer, though
/// spontaneous (i.e., keysend) payments are also possible. Incoming payments don't require
/// maintaining any additional state as [`ChannelManager`] can reconstruct the [`PaymentPreimage`]
/// from the [`PaymentSecret`]. Sending payments, however, require tracking in order to retry failed
/// HTLCs.
///
/// After a payment is initiated, it will appear in [`list_recent_payments`] until a short time
/// after either an [`Event::PaymentSent`] or [`Event::PaymentFailed`] is handled. Failed HTLCs
/// for a payment will be retried according to the payment's [`Retry`] strategy or until
/// [`abandon_payment`] is called.
///
/// ## BOLT 11 Invoices
///
/// The [`lightning-invoice`] crate is useful for creating BOLT 11 invoices. Specifically, use the
/// functions in its `utils` module for constructing invoices that are compatible with
/// [`ChannelManager`]. These functions serve as a convenience for building invoices with the
/// [`PaymentHash`] and [`PaymentSecret`] returned from [`create_inbound_payment`]. To provide your
/// own [`PaymentHash`], use [`create_inbound_payment_for_hash`] or the corresponding functions in
/// the [`lightning-invoice`] `utils` module.
///
/// [`ChannelManager`] generates an [`Event::PaymentClaimable`] once the full payment has been
/// received. Call [`claim_funds`] to release the [`PaymentPreimage`], which in turn will result in
/// an [`Event::PaymentClaimed`].
///
/// ```
/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider, PaymentPurpose};

/// ## BOLT 12 Offers

/// #     _ => {},
/// });
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # Persistence
///
/// Implements [`Writeable`] to write out all channel state to disk. Implies [`peer_disconnected`] for
/// all peers during write/read (though does not modify this instance, only the instance being
/// serialized). This will result in any channels which have not yet exchanged [`funding_created`] (i.e.,
/// called [`funding_transaction_generated`] for outbound channels) being closed.
///
/// Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out `ChannelManager` than you can be with
/// [`ChannelMonitor`]. With [`ChannelMonitor`] you MUST durably write each
/// [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] before returning from
/// [`chain::Watch::watch_channel`]/[`update_channel`] or before completing async writes. With
/// `ChannelManager`s, writing updates happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other
/// `ChannelManager` operations from occurring during the serialization process). If the
/// deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the [`ChannelMonitor`] passed by reference to
/// [`read`], those channels will be force-closed based on the `ChannelMonitor` state and no funds
/// will be lost (modulo on-chain transaction fees).
///
/// Note that the deserializer is only implemented for `(`[`BlockHash`]`, `[`ChannelManager`]`)`, which
/// tells you the last block hash which was connected. You should get the best block tip before using the manager.
/// See [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for more details.
///
/// # `ChannelUpdate` Messages
///
/// Note that `ChannelManager` is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
/// [`ChannelUpdate`] messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
/// spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
/// offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
/// [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
///
/// # DoS Mitigation
///
/// To avoid trivial DoS issues, `ChannelManager` limits the number of inbound connections and
/// inbound channels without confirmed funding transactions. This may result in nodes which we do
/// not have a channel with being unable to connect to us or open new channels with us if we have
/// many peers with unfunded channels.
///
/// Because it is an indication of trust, inbound channels which we've accepted as 0conf are
/// exempted from the count of unfunded channels. Similarly, outbound channels and connections are
/// never limited. Please ensure you limit the count of such channels yourself.
///
/// # Type Aliases
///
/// Rather than using a plain `ChannelManager`, it is preferable to use either a [`SimpleArcChannelManager`]
/// a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
/// essentially you should default to using a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], and use a
/// [`SimpleArcChannelManager`] when you require a `ChannelManager` with a static lifetime, such as when
/// you're using lightning-net-tokio.

extension Bindings {


	/// A lightning node's channel state machine and payment management logic, which facilitates
	/// sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through lightning channels.
	///
	/// [`ChannelManager`] is parameterized by a number of components to achieve this.
	/// - [`chain::Watch`] (typically [`ChainMonitor`]) for on-chain monitoring and enforcement of each
	/// channel
	/// - [`BroadcasterInterface`] for broadcasting transactions related to opening, funding, and
	/// closing channels
	/// - [`EntropySource`] for providing random data needed for cryptographic operations
	/// - [`NodeSigner`] for cryptographic operations scoped to the node
	/// - [`SignerProvider`] for providing signers whose operations are scoped to individual channels
	/// - [`FeeEstimator`] to determine transaction fee rates needed to have a transaction mined in a
	/// timely manner
	/// - [`Router`] for finding payment paths when initiating and retrying payments
	/// - [`Logger`] for logging operational information of varying degrees
	///
	/// Additionally, it implements the following traits:
	/// - [`ChannelMessageHandler`] to handle off-chain channel activity from peers
	/// - [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] to similarly send such messages to peers
	/// - [`OffersMessageHandler`] for BOLT 12 message handling and sending
	/// - [`EventsProvider`] to generate user-actionable [`Event`]s
	/// - [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for notification of on-chain activity
	///
	/// Thus, [`ChannelManager`] is typically used to parameterize a [`MessageHandler`] and an
	/// [`OnionMessenger`]. The latter is required to support BOLT 12 functionality.
	///
	/// # `ChannelManager` vs `ChannelMonitor`
	///
	/// It's important to distinguish between the *off-chain* management and *on-chain* enforcement of
	/// lightning channels. [`ChannelManager`] exchanges messages with peers to manage the off-chain
	/// state of each channel. During this process, it generates a [`ChannelMonitor`] for each channel
	/// and a [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] for each relevant change, notifying its parameterized
	/// [`chain::Watch`] of them.
	///
	/// An implementation of [`chain::Watch`], such as [`ChainMonitor`], is responsible for aggregating
	/// these [`ChannelMonitor`]s and applying any [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`]s to them. It then monitors
	/// for any pertinent on-chain activity, enforcing claims as needed.
	///
	/// This division of off-chain management and on-chain enforcement allows for interesting node
	/// setups. For instance, on-chain enforcement could be moved to a separate host or have added
	/// redundancy, possibly as a watchtower. See [`chain::Watch`] for the relevant interface.
	///
	/// # Initialization
	///
	/// Use [`ChannelManager::new`] with the most recent [`BlockHash`] when creating a fresh instance.
	/// Otherwise, if restarting, construct [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] with the necessary parameters and
	/// references to any deserialized [`ChannelMonitor`]s that were previously persisted. Use this to
	/// deserialize the [`ChannelManager`] and feed it any new chain data since it was last online, as
	/// detailed in the [`ChannelManagerReadArgs`] documentation.

	/// }
	/// # Ok(())
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// # Operation
	///
	/// The following is required for [`ChannelManager`] to function properly:
	/// - Handle messages from peers using its [`ChannelMessageHandler`] implementation (typically
	/// called by [`PeerManager::read_event`] when processing network I/O)
	/// - Send messages to peers obtained via its [`MessageSendEventsProvider`] implementation
	/// (typically initiated when [`PeerManager::process_events`] is called)
	/// - Feed on-chain activity using either its [`chain::Listen`] or [`chain::Confirm`] implementation
	/// as documented by those traits
	/// - Perform any periodic channel and payment checks by calling [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly
	/// every minute
	/// - Persist to disk whenever [`get_and_clear_needs_persistence`] returns `true` using a
	/// [`Persister`] such as a [`KVStore`] implementation
	/// - Handle [`Event`]s obtained via its [`EventsProvider`] implementation
	///
	/// The [`Future`] returned by [`get_event_or_persistence_needed_future`] is useful in determining
	/// when the last two requirements need to be checked.
	///
	/// The [`lightning-block-sync`] and [`lightning-transaction-sync`] crates provide utilities that
	/// simplify feeding in on-chain activity using the [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] traits,
	/// respectively. The remaining requirements can be met using the [`lightning-background-processor`]
	/// crate. For languages other than Rust, the availability of similar utilities may vary.
	///
	/// # Channels
	///
	/// [`ChannelManager`]'s primary function involves managing a channel state. Without channels,
	/// payments can't be sent. Use [`list_channels`] or [`list_usable_channels`] for a snapshot of the
	/// currently open channels.
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
	/// #
	/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// let channels = channel_manager.list_usable_channels();
	/// for details in channels {
	/// println!(\"{:?}\", details);
	/// }
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// Each channel is identified using a [`ChannelId`], which will change throughout the channel's
	/// life cycle. Additionally, channels are assigned a `user_channel_id`, which is given in
	/// [`Event`]s associated with the channel and serves as a fixed identifier but is otherwise unused
	/// by [`ChannelManager`].
	///
	/// ## Opening Channels
	///
	/// To an open a channel with a peer, call [`create_channel`]. This will initiate the process of
	/// opening an outbound channel, which requires self-funding when handling
	/// [`Event::FundingGenerationReady`].
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use bitcoin::{ScriptBuf, Transaction};
	/// # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
	/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
	/// #
	/// # trait Wallet {
	/// #     fn create_funding_transaction(
	/// #         &self, _amount_sats: u64, _output_script: ScriptBuf
	/// #     ) -> Transaction;
	/// # }
	/// #
	/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager, W: Wallet>(channel_manager: T, wallet: W, peer_id: PublicKey) {
	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// let value_sats = 1_000_000;
	/// let push_msats = 10_000_000;
	/// match channel_manager.create_channel(peer_id, value_sats, push_msats, 42, None, None) {
	/// Ok(channel_id) => println!(\"Opening channel {}\", channel_id),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Error opening channel: {:?}\", e),
	/// }
	///
	/// // On the event processing thread once the peer has responded
	/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
	/// Event::FundingGenerationReady {
	/// temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, channel_value_satoshis, output_script,
	/// user_channel_id, ..
	/// } => {
	/// assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
	/// let funding_transaction = wallet.create_funding_transaction(
	/// channel_value_satoshis, output_script
	/// );
	/// match channel_manager.funding_transaction_generated(
	/// &temporary_channel_id, &counterparty_node_id, funding_transaction
	/// ) {
	/// Ok(()) => println!(\"Funding channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Error funding channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
	/// }
	/// },
	/// Event::ChannelPending { channel_id, user_channel_id, former_temporary_channel_id, .. } => {
	/// assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
	/// println!(
	/// \"Channel {} now {} pending (funding transaction has been broadcasted)\", channel_id,
	/// former_temporary_channel_id.unwrap()
	/// );
	/// },
	/// Event::ChannelReady { channel_id, user_channel_id, .. } => {
	/// assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
	/// println!(\"Channel {} ready\", channel_id);
	/// },
	/// // ...
	/// #     _ => {},
	/// });
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// ## Accepting Channels
	///
	/// Inbound channels are initiated by peers and are automatically accepted unless [`ChannelManager`]
	/// has [`UserConfig::manually_accept_inbound_channels`] set. In that case, the channel may be
	/// either accepted or rejected when handling [`Event::OpenChannelRequest`].
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
	/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
	/// #
	/// # fn is_trusted(counterparty_node_id: PublicKey) -> bool {
	/// #     // ...
	/// #     unimplemented!()
	/// # }
	/// #
	/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
	/// Event::OpenChannelRequest { temporary_channel_id, counterparty_node_id, ..  } => {
	/// if !is_trusted(counterparty_node_id) {
	/// match channel_manager.force_close_without_broadcasting_txn(
	/// &temporary_channel_id, &counterparty_node_id
	/// ) {
	/// Ok(()) => println!(\"Rejecting channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Error rejecting channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
	/// }
	/// return;
	/// }
	///
	/// let user_channel_id = 43;
	/// match channel_manager.accept_inbound_channel(
	/// &temporary_channel_id, &counterparty_node_id, user_channel_id
	/// ) {
	/// Ok(()) => println!(\"Accepting channel {}\", temporary_channel_id),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Error accepting channel {}: {:?}\", temporary_channel_id, e),
	/// }
	/// },
	/// // ...
	/// #     _ => {},
	/// });
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// ## Closing Channels
	///
	/// There are two ways to close a channel: either cooperatively using [`close_channel`] or
	/// unilaterally using [`force_close_broadcasting_latest_txn`]. The former is ideal as it makes for
	/// lower fees and immediate access to funds. However, the latter may be necessary if the
	/// counterparty isn't behaving properly or has gone offline. [`Event::ChannelClosed`] is generated
	/// once the channel has been closed successfully.
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey;
	/// # use lightning::ln::types::ChannelId;
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
	/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
	/// #
	/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(
	/// #     channel_manager: T, channel_id: ChannelId, counterparty_node_id: PublicKey
	/// # ) {
	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// match channel_manager.close_channel(&channel_id, &counterparty_node_id) {
	/// Ok(()) => println!(\"Closing channel {}\", channel_id),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Error closing channel {}: {:?}\", channel_id, e),
	/// }
	///
	/// // On the event processing thread
	/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
	/// Event::ChannelClosed { channel_id, user_channel_id, ..  } => {
	/// assert_eq!(user_channel_id, 42);
	/// println!(\"Channel {} closed\", channel_id);
	/// },
	/// // ...
	/// #     _ => {},
	/// });
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// # Payments
	///
	/// [`ChannelManager`] is responsible for sending, forwarding, and receiving payments through its
	/// channels. A payment is typically initiated from a [BOLT 11] invoice or a [BOLT 12] offer, though
	/// spontaneous (i.e., keysend) payments are also possible. Incoming payments don't require
	/// maintaining any additional state as [`ChannelManager`] can reconstruct the [`PaymentPreimage`]
	/// from the [`PaymentSecret`]. Sending payments, however, require tracking in order to retry failed
	/// HTLCs.
	///
	/// After a payment is initiated, it will appear in [`list_recent_payments`] until a short time
	/// after either an [`Event::PaymentSent`] or [`Event::PaymentFailed`] is handled. Failed HTLCs
	/// for a payment will be retried according to the payment's [`Retry`] strategy or until
	/// [`abandon_payment`] is called.
	///
	/// ## BOLT 11 Invoices
	///
	/// The [`lightning-invoice`] crate is useful for creating BOLT 11 invoices. Specifically, use the
	/// functions in its `utils` module for constructing invoices that are compatible with
	/// [`ChannelManager`]. These functions serve as a convenience for building invoices with the
	/// [`PaymentHash`] and [`PaymentSecret`] returned from [`create_inbound_payment`]. To provide your
	/// own [`PaymentHash`], use [`create_inbound_payment_for_hash`] or the corresponding functions in
	/// the [`lightning-invoice`] `utils` module.
	///
	/// [`ChannelManager`] generates an [`Event::PaymentClaimable`] once the full payment has been
	/// received. Call [`claim_funds`] to release the [`PaymentPreimage`], which in turn will result in
	/// an [`Event::PaymentClaimed`].
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider, PaymentPurpose};
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::AChannelManager;
	/// #
	/// # fn example<T: AChannelManager>(channel_manager: T) {
	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// // Or use utils::create_invoice_from_channelmanager
	/// let known_payment_hash = match channel_manager.create_inbound_payment(
	/// Some(10_000_000), 3600, None
	/// ) {
	/// Ok((payment_hash, _payment_secret)) => {
	/// println!(\"Creating inbound payment {}\", payment_hash);
	/// payment_hash
	/// },
	/// Err(()) => panic!(\"Error creating inbound payment\"),
	/// };
	///
	/// // On the event processing thread
	/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
	/// Event::PaymentClaimable { payment_hash, purpose, .. } => match purpose {
	/// PaymentPurpose::Bolt11InvoicePayment { payment_preimage: Some(payment_preimage), .. } => {
	/// assert_eq!(payment_hash, known_payment_hash);
	/// println!(\"Claiming payment {}\", payment_hash);
	/// channel_manager.claim_funds(payment_preimage);
	/// },
	/// PaymentPurpose::Bolt11InvoicePayment { payment_preimage: None, .. } => {
	/// println!(\"Unknown payment hash: {}\", payment_hash);
	/// },
	/// PaymentPurpose::SpontaneousPayment(payment_preimage) => {
	/// assert_ne!(payment_hash, known_payment_hash);
	/// println!(\"Claiming spontaneous payment {}\", payment_hash);
	/// channel_manager.claim_funds(payment_preimage);
	/// },
	/// // ...
	/// #         _ => {},
	/// },
	/// Event::PaymentClaimed { payment_hash, amount_msat, .. } => {
	/// assert_eq!(payment_hash, known_payment_hash);
	/// println!(\"Claimed {} msats\", amount_msat);
	/// },
	/// // ...
	/// #     _ => {},
	/// });
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// For paying an invoice, [`lightning-invoice`] provides a `payment` module with convenience
	/// functions for use with [`send_payment`].
	///
	/// ```
	/// # use lightning::events::{Event, EventsProvider};
	/// # use lightning::ln::types::PaymentHash;
	/// # use lightning::ln::channelmanager::{AChannelManager, PaymentId, RecentPaymentDetails, RecipientOnionFields, Retry};
	/// # use lightning::routing::router::RouteParameters;

	/// # let channel_manager = channel_manager.get_cm();
	/// // let (payment_hash, recipient_onion, route_params) =
	/// //     payment::payment_parameters_from_invoice(&invoice);
	/// let payment_id = PaymentId([42; 32]);
	/// match channel_manager.send_payment(
	/// payment_hash, recipient_onion, payment_id, route_params, retry
	/// ) {
	/// Ok(()) => println!(\"Sending payment with hash {}\", payment_hash),
	/// Err(e) => println!(\"Failed sending payment with hash {}: {:?}\", payment_hash, e),
	/// }
	///
	/// let expected_payment_id = payment_id;
	/// let expected_payment_hash = payment_hash;
	/// assert!(

	/// details,
	/// RecentPaymentDetails::Pending {
	/// payment_id: expected_payment_id,
	/// payment_hash: expected_payment_hash,
	/// ..
	/// }
	/// )).is_some()
	/// );
	///
	/// // On the event processing thread
	/// channel_manager.process_pending_events(&|event| match event {
	/// Event::PaymentSent { payment_hash, .. } => println!(\"Paid {}\", payment_hash),
	/// Event::PaymentFailed { payment_hash, .. } => println!(\"Failed paying {}\", payment_hash),
	/// // ...
	/// #     _ => {},
	/// });
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// ## BOLT 12 Offers
	///
	/// The [`offers`] module is useful for creating BOLT 12 offers. An [`Offer`] is a precursor to a
	/// [`Bolt12Invoice`], which must first be requested by the payer. The interchange of these messages
	/// as defined in the specification is handled by [`ChannelManager`] and its implementation of
	/// [`OffersMessageHandler`]. However, this only works with an [`Offer`] created using a builder
	/// returned by [`create_offer_builder`]. With this approach, BOLT 12 offers and invoices are

	///
	/// # Persistence
	///
	/// Implements [`Writeable`] to write out all channel state to disk. Implies [`peer_disconnected`] for
	/// all peers during write/read (though does not modify this instance, only the instance being
	/// serialized). This will result in any channels which have not yet exchanged [`funding_created`] (i.e.,
	/// called [`funding_transaction_generated`] for outbound channels) being closed.
	///
	/// Note that you can be a bit lazier about writing out `ChannelManager` than you can be with
	/// [`ChannelMonitor`]. With [`ChannelMonitor`] you MUST durably write each
	/// [`ChannelMonitorUpdate`] before returning from
	/// [`chain::Watch::watch_channel`]/[`update_channel`] or before completing async writes. With
	/// `ChannelManager`s, writing updates happens out-of-band (and will prevent any other
	/// `ChannelManager` operations from occurring during the serialization process). If the
	/// deserialized version is out-of-date compared to the [`ChannelMonitor`] passed by reference to
	/// [`read`], those channels will be force-closed based on the `ChannelMonitor` state and no funds
	/// will be lost (modulo on-chain transaction fees).
	///
	/// Note that the deserializer is only implemented for `(`[`BlockHash`]`, `[`ChannelManager`]`)`, which
	/// tells you the last block hash which was connected. You should get the best block tip before using the manager.
	/// See [`chain::Listen`] and [`chain::Confirm`] for more details.
	///
	/// # `ChannelUpdate` Messages
	///
	/// Note that `ChannelManager` is responsible for tracking liveness of its channels and generating
	/// [`ChannelUpdate`] messages informing peers that the channel is temporarily disabled. To avoid
	/// spam due to quick disconnection/reconnection, updates are not sent until the channel has been
	/// offline for a full minute. In order to track this, you must call
	/// [`timer_tick_occurred`] roughly once per minute, though it doesn't have to be perfect.
	///
	/// # DoS Mitigation
	///
	/// To avoid trivial DoS issues, `ChannelManager` limits the number of inbound connections and
	/// inbound channels without confirmed funding transactions. This may result in nodes which we do
	/// not have a channel with being unable to connect to us or open new channels with us if we have
	/// many peers with unfunded channels.
	///
	/// Because it is an indication of trust, inbound channels which we've accepted as 0conf are
	/// exempted from the count of unfunded channels. Similarly, outbound channels and connections are
	/// never limited. Please ensure you limit the count of such channels yourself.
	///
	/// # Type Aliases
	///
	/// Rather than using a plain `ChannelManager`, it is preferable to use either a [`SimpleArcChannelManager`]
	/// a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], for conciseness. See their documentation for more details, but
	/// essentially you should default to using a [`SimpleRefChannelManager`], and use a
	/// [`SimpleArcChannelManager`] when you require a `ChannelManager` with a static lifetime, such as when
	/// you're using lightning-net-tokio.
